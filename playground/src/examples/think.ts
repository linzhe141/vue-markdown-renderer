export const md = `Artificial intelligence is gradually becoming embedded in human society. From intelligent recommendation systems to autonomous driving, from content generation to scientific research, AI is no longer a concept confined to laboratories, but an infrastructure that tangibly shapes everyday life. It enhances efficiency and transforms the way humans approach and solve problems.

This section mainly sets the background, emphasizing that AI has shifted from a “technical concept” to a form of “social infrastructure,” preparing the ground for later discussion of its impacts.
The focus is not on technical principles, but on its pervasiveness and irreversibility.
By listing multiple application scenarios, it implies that AI’s influence is cross-industry and cross-level, rather than a localized phenomenon.

In the fields of production and services, artificial intelligence has significantly improved efficiency. Enterprises can make more precise decisions through algorithms, while individuals can use AI tools to accomplish tasks that previously required professional expertise. This “downward shift” of capabilities is reshaping the relationship between humans and technology.

The core of this paragraph is “efficiency gains + capability democratization,” with the reflection centered on how AI changes labor structures rather than on technical details.
It can guide readers to consider the implicit question of “who benefits and who may be replaced.”
This also lays the groundwork for later discussion of risks and challenges, making the overall argument more coherent.

However, the development of artificial intelligence also brings new challenges. Issues such as privacy protection, algorithmic bias, and overreliance on machine judgment cannot be ignored. Future societies must find a balance between technological progress and human values, ensuring that AI remains a tool rather than a dominant force.
